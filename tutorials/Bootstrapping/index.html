<p>Bootstrapping is a well-established method for estimating statistical errors (rather than, say, systematic or
technical errors). The idea behind the bootstrap is to ask how much the estimate of whatever
you&rsquo;re interested (e.g. the mean of your data) would have changed if you&rsquo;d collected a slightly
different set of data, but still drawn from the same underlying population distribution.
If your estimate is being substantially influenced by an outlier or some other
peculiarity not representative of the data set, the bootstrap can let you know.</p>

<p>Say you have 100 samples; how much does your estimate of the mean depend on a particular 10 of them? What if
you collected samples over several days, and one day, for whatever reason, all of your sample
values from that day were a little bit larger than the rest? How much would it change your estimate of
the mean if you&rsquo;d not collected data that day? A large part of statistics is about answering the question,
what estimates of my sample mean would I have obtained if I re-ran this experiment 100 or 1000
more times? The bootstrap attempts to answer this question by direct simulation.</p>

<p>The classic reference on bootstrapping and why it works is Efron and Tibshirani (1993),
<strong>An introduction to the bootstrap</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<p>The most essential prerequisite for the bootstrapping routine is the size of your data. You
really can&rsquo;t bootstrap a data set with 3 numbers in it. For the kinds of single molecule data
I&rsquo;ve encountered, I&rsquo;ve found 50-100 samples to be fine, but the more the better.</p>

<p>As a corollary to the data set size, your sample data set also needs to span
a representative range of possible measurement values. Let&rsquo;s say the underlying population you&rsquo;re
measuring is Gaussian distributed around a mean of 20. Let&rsquo;s say you make 10
measurements of this population, and all the samples happen to be concentrated
around the value 15. (Small sample sizes&ndash;it can happen!) When you bootstrap an
estimator for the mean, because your sample&rsquo;s variability didn&rsquo;t accurately
represent the population variability, all the bootstrapped estimates might be
near 15, and you might erroneously conclude that you have low statistical
uncertainty. If we had drawn a larger dataset, this kind of fluke would be
exponentially unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>How do you if you have &ldquo;enough&rdquo; data? Well, when in doubt, take more data and see if it
changes the estimate of the mean. Alternatively, you can generate multiple sub-sets of your
data, of varying size, to ask how confident your estimate of the mean would have been if you&rsquo;d
collected, say, half the data. That is, sub-sample your whole data set with
replacement, generating, say, 100 new data sets that each have half the number of measurements
of your full data set. (&ldquo;With replacement&rdquo; means each sub-sample can have duplicates from
your original data set.) Calculate the mean value (or whatever your parameter of interest is)
for each 100 new half-sized data sets. How much does that mean value vary? What if your sub-sampled
data sets had a quarter of the data?</p>

<h2 id="bootstrapping-time-trajectories-or-comparable">Bootstrapping time trajectories (or comparable)</h2>

<p>Single-molecule data often take the form of time trajectories, in which something (e.g.,
FRET value) is measured over time. Often these time trajectories have multiple states
or events, and you may want to quantify something for each state. For example, say each
time trajectory explores three different states, and you quantify the mean dwell time or
mean lifetime of each state. For 100 time trajectories, each with 3 states, this would give
you 3 data sets, each with 100 numbers in them.</p>

<p>When you bootstrap these data to estimate the error on each mean dwell time, you have to
decide whether to bootstrap over <em>dwell times</em>, or over <em>trajectories</em>. That is, do you
treat each of the 3 sets of dwell times independently, and bootstrap each separately?
Or do you take into account that these 3 sets of numbers may not be independent from each
other? What if there are correlations between dwells&ndash;e.g., if one trajectory has a really
long first dwell, perhaps the second and third dwells are especially long as well. (Maybe
that one molecule was just really slow, at everything!)</p>

<p>My choice is usually to bootstrap over trajectories, going with the principle of, what
if I&rsquo;d happened not to collect this particular trajectory as part of my data set. Or if I&rsquo;d
collected 5 of them instead of 1.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping with respect to trajectories requires a slight modification to a standard
bootstrapping routine, as described below.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>If whatever software or language you&rsquo;re doing data analysis in has a built-in bootstrapping
function, use that. Matlab has one (called bootstrp).</p>

<p>The outline of a very simple bootstrapping routine would be:</p>

<p>(1) Load your data, or generate some random data for testing purposes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-matlab">data = randn(1,87);
</code></pre>

<p>(2) Generate 1000 bootstrapped data sets (these days, with
computers as fast as they are, 1000 or even 10,000 is not unreasonable.
You can certainly have too few bootstrapped samples, but anything above a
couple hundred should be fine. Above a reasonable threshold, increasing
the number of bootstrapped data sets shouldn&rsquo;t affect your estimate of
the error!):</p>

<pre><code class="language-matlab">num_bs = 1000;
</code></pre>

<p>(3) Call Matlab&rsquo;s bootstrapping function. Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m trying to estimate the error
on the sample mean:</p>

<pre><code class="language-matlab">means_bs = bootstrp(num_bs, @(x) mean(x), data);
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, to bootstrap with respect to trajectories, I
first generate a resampled-with-replacement set of trajectory
indicies&ndash;that is, if I have 87 trajectories, I assign them each a
number (usually the order they load in) and then resample with
replacement the indicies. Note below that instead of bootstrapping data directly,
I&rsquo;m bootstrapping indices:</p>

<pre><code class="language-matlab">bootstat = bootstrp(num_bs, @(x) x, 1:length(data));
</code></pre>

<p>Here, each row of <code>bootstat</code> will be a set of indices with which to resample
data with replacement (bootstat will have size <code>num_bs</code> by <code>length(data)</code>).</p>

<p>Then I generate new data sets based on each row of bootstat&ndash;for example,
load all the trajectories corresponding to the indicies in the first row
of bootstat, then extract the durations of the first dwell for each of
these trajectories, and take the mean of those values. Then extract the
durations of the second dwell of these trajectories and calculate the mean. Etc.
Then move on to the next row of bootstat. Re-load the appropriate trajectories, extract
all their first dwell durations &hellip; Eventually I would have num_bs new mean values for each
dwell time.</p>

<p>(4) I report the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means as my estimate
of the standard error on the mean:</p>

<pre><code class="language-matlab">err = std(means_bs);
</code></pre>
